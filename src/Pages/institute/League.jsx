            It's a common misconception that rejecting articles will
            automatically lead to journal growth. While it's true that
            maintaining high standards and rejecting low-quality submissions is
            crucial for a journal's reputation, it's not a guaranteed path to
            increased submissions.{" "}
          </p>
          <p className="mt-[15px]">Here's why:</p>
          <ul className="mt-[15pt]">

              <span className="font-semibold">
                <i> Rejection can deter potential authors: </i>
              </span>{" "}
              If a journal is perceived as overly strict or difficult to publish
              in, it can discourage potential authors from submitting their
              work. This can lead to a vicious cycle of fewer submissions and a
              smaller pool of high-quality articles.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold">
                <i> Rejection doesn't address the root cause: </i>
              </span>{" "}
              Rejecting articles doesn't address the underlying reasons why
              you're not receiving enough submissions. It's important to
              identify and address those issues, such as a lack of visibility,
              limited scope, or a perceived lack of value.

              </span>{" "}
              While it's important to maintain high standards, it's also crucial
              to strike a balance between quality and quantity. A journal with a
              small number of high-quality articles can still be influential and
              respected.
