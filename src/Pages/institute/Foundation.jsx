            <i>2. Rationale</i>
          </h3>
          <ul className="mt-[15px]">
            <li>
               The need for a dedicated foundation focused on international
              nursing research, education, and clinical practices is driven by
              several critical factors:
            </li>

            <li>
               Global Health Challenges: The world faces complex and
              interconnected health challenges, including infectious diseases,
              chronic illnesses, mental health issues, and the impact of climate
              change. These challenges require innovative solutions, and nursing
              plays a vital role in addressing them. A foundation dedicated to
              nursing research can contribute to developing evidence-based
              practices and interventions that improve health outcomes globally.
            </li>

            <li>
               Strengthening Nursing Education: The IFN will provide
              opportunities for faculty and students to engage in international
              collaborations, enhancing their knowledge and skills. This will
              involve facilitating exchange programs, joint research projects,
              and guest lectures by renowned international nursing experts. By
              fostering a global learning environment, the foundation will equip
              future nurses with the skills and perspectives needed to address
              the diverse health challenges of the 21st century.
            </li>
            <li>
               Promoting Clinical Excellence: The foundation will facilitate
              the exchange of best practices and foster the development of
              innovative clinical models. This will involve supporting the
              implementation of evidence-based practices, promoting the use of
              technology in nursing care, and facilitating the development of
              new clinical models tailored to the specific needs of the Niger
              Delta region and other underserved communities.
            </li>
            <li>
               Building Capacity: The FOUNDATION will support the development
              of nursing leaders and researchers in the Niger Delta region and
              beyond. This will involve providing scholarships and fellowships
              for postgraduate studies, supporting the development of research
              capacity, and offering mentorship programs for aspiring nursing
              leaders. By investing in the next generation of nurses, the
              foundation will contribute to building a strong and sustainable
              nursing workforce.
            </li>
            <li>
              Addressing Health Disparities: The Niger Delta region faces unique
              health challenges, including high rates of maternal and child
              mortality, infectious diseases, and environmental health risks.
              The IFN will prioritize research and clinical practice initiatives
              that address these disparities, ensuring that all communities have
              access to quality nursing care.
